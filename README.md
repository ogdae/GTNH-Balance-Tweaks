# GTNH Balance Tweaks

A lightweight addon mod for GregTech: New Horizons that adjusts the time and power usage of GregTech machines.  
Currently built and tested on **GTNH 2.8.0 RC1**. Presumed to work on future versions, but not guaranteed.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: This mod is experimental and untested. It may break long-term worlds. Use at your own risk.  
If you run into issues, please open a ticket on GitHub or contact me directly on Discord (`rilliko`).

## ‚ú® Features
- Halves recipe time and EU/t for most GregTech machines by default.  
- Primitive Blast Furnace recipes run 4√ó faster.  
- Configurable multipliers so you can tune recipes easier *or* harder depending on your preference.    
- Works on both client and server.  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
A config file is generated at:  
`/config/gtnhbalancetweaks.cfg`  

You can adjust multipliers on a **per-machine basis**, or globally if you want everything treated the same:  

- `RecipeTimeMultiplier` ‚Üí default `0.5`  
- `EuPerTickMultiplier` ‚Üí default `0.5`  
- `PrimitiveBlastTimeMultiplier` ‚Üí default `0.25`  

Examples:  
- `0.1` ‚Üí recipes are 10√ó faster and 10√ó cheaper.  
- `2.0` ‚Üí recipes are 2√ó slower and 2√ó more expensive.  
- Per-machine overrides let you make, for example, **cutting machines cheap**, but **furnaces expensive**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Additional Disclaimer
This code was created with major assistance from ChatGPT. While every effort has been made to test functionality, unexpected behavior may occur. Don't expect fantastic work if you take a look at the code yourself, I have no idea what I'm doing, but the mod works well enough for me and my friends. Again, use at your own risk.
